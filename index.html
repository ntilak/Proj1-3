  <h2>About Me</h2>  
    
<p>I graduated from CSU Easy Bay with Master's in Computer Science. I have taught programming classes at multitple community colleges. I joined Cerritos College in Fall 2018. I taught at CSULB for three semesters. 
    After teaching programming and application classes for more than 10 years, now I want work in software industry. 
    My kids are 17 and 14, I feel, this is the perfect time for me to make this transition.
    
    I want to work as a Quality Assurance Engineer. Having a decent knowledge of HTML and CSS will help me to understand
    the application better. I am very thankful to you for letting me take this class!!
     </p>  
<h1>When I Have free time</h1> 
     
<ol> 
    <li>Walking! I always find time for it. It's kind of meditation for me.</li>
    <li>Reading! I like to read articles. I don't have patience to read thick books.</li>
    <li>TV! Watching some documentry/movies.</li>
    
</ol>   
My Favorite website is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank"><b>W3Schools</b> </a>. I can learn CS faster here. It's simple. <br>    

My second favorite website is <a href = "https://www.udemy.com/"><b>Udemy</b></a>. I can learn many things at a very reasonable rates.
